

Problem Statement -- With the youth saving money and money managment is unlearned skill, and since that 
			many young adults are going into debt. As someone who was faced with a similar issue, I believed
			there would be a way to have program take my money then budget it and manage it for me. That is why I
			started creating the finance calculator.

Outline Goals -- Have an app that takes in income from the user then takes out the taxes and fees then allows them to split
		up there money into various categories to have them budget easily.

Chart Boundaries -- The major boundary would be using swift so that the app is an iOS application

Success Criteria -- Similar to rubrics, is what is in the assessment to achieve a successful product

Constraints -- The given time in which the project must be completed in as well as the limitations of iOS development compared to
		android development. Another constraint include the data alloweed to be accessed from the user without getting into 
		too much legality.

Assumptions -- The project will be easier to update since the base of the program was once created in python and later moved to Java. 
		Assuming the app will be easily design and very user friendly.

Stakeholders -- The programmer themself (me), Professor Vanselow since its a class assignment as well. Students and friends who will 
		be testing and potential using the application.

Timeline -- 1) Understand Swift and get an idea (3-4 hours)
		2) Determine the final outcome of the product and start working backwords with features (2-3 hours)
		3) Understand the application from a layout perspective and create a flowchart (1-3 hours)
		4) start development (many hours)
