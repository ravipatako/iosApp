Week 1 -- Looking back at week 1 it was difficult because I had no idea what I wanted to do or where to start. I know I wanted to do something in swift and deal with iOS. I decided to take a previous project, the Finance Calculator, and redo it in Swift. 

Weeek 2 - I started looking into Swift Turtorial on YouTube and slowly started watching. I was off to a bad start since my Mac was acting up but eventually I was able to download xCode and start beginning the design process. At this point, I also realized that I did not want to do the finance calculator anymore and wanted to search for something that I really enjoyed and could help me. I came up with an idea that incorporated some of my sneaker idea. If you have seen my portfolio, then you know about my sneaker hussle but if you havent let me give you a run down. On the side, I will take rare sneakers that have been bought at retail and resell them at a higher mark-up for profit. The game is a lot hard then it looks so I wanted something that could help me and even some other fellow sneakerheads inside the game. As this point, the idea would be app that allows users to input their sneaker and the price it was bought at and then give them some values at which they could sell them for and allow them to see how much they make.

Plan for Week 2 - Currently it is the end of week 2 and I have some goals for what I want to have done by the end of week 3. 
	- First off, I want to have an exact layout of what the app will do and how it will accomplish the task
		- I also want to layout the exact task the app will do
	- Secondly, I want further my Swift tutorial because I have recently became lazy about them and have touched them in a little 			bit
	- Third, this is optional if I can get the first two steps done, I want to begin to start creating the basics of the app in 			Swift
	
Week 3 - Earlier in the week, I spent an hour looking into different business concepts on profits and margins just to get an idea of what I wanted from my application. (Hours spent = 1) Learned = I learned about the different variables that will be playing in my application that I need to factor in, I also realized on how I should look at my profit margins, since I want to achieve a certain percentage versus getting a specific sold price. The first formula I got that was my start point was (net profit)/(net sales) but that is not what I wanted so I decided I needed to look more into the formulas. Since I will be calculating the margins per sale versus the net sales I saw that this wasnt going to work.
	- (Time spent = 30min) Later in the week I was able to sit down with my professor and get him to look over what I had so far, and he was able to give me some input and together we started desiging the IPO for the application. He talked to me about starting simple and getting the basic calculations in and then moving into more complex calculations. 
	The input that will be getting take in will include the purchased price, shipping (for now, we talked about UPS API a bit for down the road), prices for boxes but for right now that will be set to 0 since they werent paid for. I also wanted to take input for ad Money so that each product has its own chance to be advertised. Then the major change was having the user select how much desired profit they are looking for.
	
	- (Time spent = 30min) After talking to my Professor, I starting think about how I want the UI to look and what kind of designs I was looking for. At first I am going to just get a simple one page layout where the user will input their numbers and then it will just prompt them with their desired selling price.
	I learned how easy it is to create the UI in xCode so I began starting to draw out some idea on how I want to design the layout. For the most part, the page will just include text box that will be used for user input and then have an area on the screen where the prices will be printed out, again starting out super simple. I have been looking at more videos about UI design in xCode from CodeWithChris on YouTube just because I started liking his teaching style and speed.
	
Plan for Week 4 -- In week 4, I would like to start actually building the application. For now everything will designed for the iPhone XS max since that is the device I have but since it is built in xCode getting to change for different devices will not be too difficult. 
	-- I also want finalize how the calculations will work but still have room to change them for more input down the road.
	-- Something thats not too important but I think will help with design, I want to start looking into color schemes for the application just because it should look clean and modern and I really dont want crazy colors with everything around the place. 
	-- By the end of this week, I would also like to have finish the swift tutorial from Chris and if I need more help move onto other people who are also knowledgeable. A major resource I would like to start using are my classmates who are also working on Swift/iOS development since they are the most knowledgable resources I have in person.
	
Week 4 - It was looking good, finally finished the got my things in order and was able to finish the tutorials. I started the project began coding the design and framework behind the app. I have also start working on the UI, currently its just some texts boxes along with the logo on top but soon there will be more to come. 
-- Major thing I changed was making the REPO private since outside of class I am trying to take this project very seriously in order to make my business better. I uploaded some pictures that I was able to create from online resources as well as the information discussed with my professor. The major trouble I had this week was pushing the xCode project to github. I start looking at some YouTube videos but found some that werent very helpful. I began looking at some stack overflow comments but have not tried them out because they seem a bit complex but definetly I will need to try soon. That is now my first priority because it needs to be done ASAP so the project is on github. The next thing I want to start working on is better the user interface and seeing if I want to add more pages to add versus just the landing page.









Problem Statement -- For sometime, I have been selling shoes but in the sneaker market prices are always changing and it can be hard to determine what a show should sell for. I want to make this process a lot easier by having an app that will automatically calculate what price I should be selling my shoes at for the maximum profit but still be low enought that a consumer is willing to pay that premium price for the shoe.


Outline Goals -- Have an app that easly takes data from the user and give them a valid estimate on what they should sell a specific sneaker for and also give them an insight on how much they are profiting.

Chart Boundaries -- The major boundary would be using swift so that the app is an iOS application as well as getting data from previous sneaker sells. For this I want to look at competitor likes StockX or Goat and see how they keep track of their data and make price adjustments according to the market.

Success Criteria -- If the app can help me sell my sneaker a bit more efficently in the way that I can focus on other things such as marketing the shoe versus having to worry what I have to sell it for compared to my competitor.

Constraints -- The time frame and the knowledge of coding that I have. The constraints would be having something to show others before the end of the semester. A personal constraint will be, keeping me motivated to keep working on this project even after the class is over.

Assumptions -- I will keep working on this constantly
		Getting data and refining how the calulations work for the app will be easy

Stakeholders -- The programmer themself (me), Professor Vanselow since its a class assignment as well. Students and friends who will 
		be testing and potential using the application. Sneakerheads who are also trying to sell their shoes and have to compete with other sellers.

Timeline -- This will be constantly updated and it will always be at the top of this TXT file.
